# Poster Creator

This simple static page lets you overlay your own photo onto a predefined poster image directly in the browser. Everything runs client side so it can be deployed easily with GitHub Pages.

## Usage

1. Place your poster template image **`poster.png`** in this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or deploy the folder with GitHub Pages.
3. Upload a photo with the file input, drag it to position, adjust its size with the slider, then click **Download** to save the final poster.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository and add the files of this folder (including your `poster.png`).
2. Commit and push to GitHub.
3. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and select the branch containing these files (typically `main`) and the **root** folder.
4. After a few seconds a public URL will be provided where the page is available.

No server is required; all processing is done in JavaScript in the browser.
